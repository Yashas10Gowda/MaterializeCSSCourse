# MaterializeCSSCourse
Worked on my UI skills and also killed a lot of time. All the projects mentioned below were built to showcase design, responsiveness, UI and not the actual working of a website as it is not connected to any backend.  

*Brad Traversy's MaterializeCSS Course... Kinda old but still got some juice.*

* First Project **TravelVille** --> A Travel agency website with pretty pictures all over. <a href="https://yashas.pythonanywhere.com/travelvilla" target="_blank">View Project</a>

* Second Project **Quazzu** --> A Code-Hosting website's Landing Page **"For Developers, By Developers"**. <a href="https://yashas.pythonanywhere.com/quazzu" target="_blank">View Project</a>

* Third Project **M-Admin** --> An Admin area interface with Graph, Todos, Posts, Users, Comments. <a href="https://yashas.pythonanywhere.com/madmin" target="_blank">View Project</a>

* Second Project **BizLand** --> <a href="https://yashas.pythonanywhere.com/quazzu" style="border:1px solid blue;" target="_blank">View</a>
