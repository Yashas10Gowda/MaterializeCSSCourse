# MaterializeCSSCourse
Worked on my UI skills and also killed a lot of time. All the projects mentioned below were built to showcase design, responsiveness, UI and not the actual working of a website as it is not connected to any backend.  

*Brad Traversy's MaterializeCSS Course... Kinda old but still got some juice.*

* **TravelVille** --> A Travel Agency Website with pretty pictures all over. <a href="https://yashas.pythonanywhere.com/ui-templates/travelville" target="_blank">Live Link</a>

* **Quazzu** --> A Code-Hosting website's Landing Page **"For Developers, By Developers"**. <a href="https://yashas.pythonanywhere.com/ui-templates/quazzu" target="_blank">Live Link</a>

* **M-Admin** --> An Admin Area Interface with Graph, Todos, Posts, Users, Comments. <a href="https://yashas.pythonanywhere.com/ui-templates/madmin" target="_blank">Live Link</a>

* **BizLand** --> A Business Securing Company's Landing Page. <a href="https://yashas.pythonanywhere.com/ui-templates/bizland" target="_blank">Live Link</a>
